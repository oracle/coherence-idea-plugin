<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin adds features to IntelliJ to assist in development of applications using Oracle Coherence.

Features:

* POF code generation for suitably annotated classes.

## Installation

- Using IDE built-in plugin system:
  
  <kbd>Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Plugins</kbd> > <kbd>Marketplace</kbd> > <kbd>Search for "coherence-idea"</kbd> >
  <kbd>Install Plugin</kbd>
  
- Manually:

  <kbd>Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Plugins</kbd> > <kbd>⚙️</kbd> > <kbd>Install plugin from disk...</kbd>

## Usage

> For full documentation on the Coherence POF code generator and using PortableType annotations
> see the official [Portable Types documentation](https://coherence.community/20.12/docs/#/docs/core/04_portable_types)

The POF code generator plugin uses the Coherence POF code generator to instrument classes tha have been annotated with
the corresponding POF annotations. The plugin is a build service plugin that will instrument classes as part of the
IntelliJ build process.

The plugin itself does not contain a `coherence.jar` or the POF code generator, it 
will use the code generator built into the version of Coherence that the current project depends on. 
This means that there is no need to upgrade the IntelliJ plugin for different versions of Coherence. 

The POF plugin is disabled by default and must be enabled for each IntelliJ project.
Once enabled, evolvable PortableType code will be generated for suitably annotated classes as part of 
the IntelliJ build process.

* Open the IntelliJ preference pane and go to the Oracle Coherence panel under Languages & Frameworks,
  
  <kbd>Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Languages & Frameworks</kbd> > <kbd>Oracle Coherence</kbd>

* Check the `Enable POF code generation` check box.
